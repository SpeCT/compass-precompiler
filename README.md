# compass-precompiler

The compass-precompiler allows you to author your stylesheets with the CSS superset of
[SASS or SCSS](http://compass-style.org/). It supports nested rules, variables, mixins, selector inheritance, and and lots of other really useful stuff. The compass files will get compiled and \_attached to your couchapp on every build and can even be compressed.

The worst thing is that it requres ruby to be installed. The best â€“ is that it much more powerfull and agile than less.


### Install

[Install Compass](http://compass-style.org/install/)

```bash
sudo gem install sass
```

Add `compass-precompiler` to your dependencies section in `kanso.json`.

```javascript
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    "compass-precompiler": null,
    ...
  }
```

> run `kanso install` to fetch the package


### Configure

To tell the precompiler which files to transform, add the section `compass`,
and in a key called `compile`, list the files you want to process.

```javascript
  ...
  "compass": {
    "compile": [ "css/style.sass", ... ]
  }
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    "compass-precompiler": null,
    ...
  }

```

> Running `kanso push` will compile the file `css/style.sass` to
`css/style.css` and upload it to `_attachments/css/style.css`.


### Compression

To enable compression of the output, add the `compress` flag and set it to `true`.

```javascript
  ...
  "compass": {
    "compile": [ ... ],
    "compress": true
  }
```

The output will additionally be compressed if you kanso push with the --minify flag, eg

```
kanso push app --minify
```


### Import paths

Compass files can import other compass templates, sometimes it's useful for a
package to provide uncompiled .sass/.scss files for use in a project. Before you
can import them in the project's templates, the package providing the
files needs to add the compass path. This is so the compiler knows where to
lookup the file when you `@import` it.

```javascript
  ...
  "compass": {
    "paths": ["./bootstrap"]
  }
```


### Removing original compass files

You can also remove any compass files from attachments (if you placed them inside a
directory also added as static files), by adding the `remove_from_attachments`
property. This will remove all attachment with a `.sass` or `.scss` extension!

```javascript
  ...
  "compass": {
    "compile": [ ... ],
    "remove_from_attachments": true
  }
```
